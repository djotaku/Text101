From a Udemy Class on Unity 2D games

At this point in time I'm just following along with the class. In this particular game in order for the different 
states to make sense, I'm most likely just going to do exactly as they do. In other games from this Udemy class I 
may go off in my own direction more. 

While I've been programming as an amatuer for a long time (nearly 30 years) and did some professionally for a few years, it's mostly
been in Python, Perl, and other high level languages. I've only done a tiny bit of C# nearly a decade ago when Linux Format Magazine
was covering it when Mono was first introduced into Linux.
